The e-Commerce Platform System project aims to design a robust database management system for an online platform where customers can browse, purchase, and manage their accounts.

The system includes entities such as customers, products, orders, payments, reviews, and shipping. It enables efficient product browsing and purchasing, accurate order and inventory management, and customer account management. Customers can track orders, manage shipping information, and view order history. The system automates inventory updates when orders are placed. Overall, the project focuses on providing a seamless and comprehensive e-commerce experience for customers while effectively managing orders, payments, and inventory.
