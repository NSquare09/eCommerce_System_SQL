# e-Commerce System (MYSQL)

The e-Commerce Platform System project aims to design a robust database management system for an online platform where customers can browse, purchase, and manage their accounts.

The system will include various entities such as customers, products, orders, payments, reviews, and shipping. Each entity will have specific attributes and relationships with other entities. For instance, customers can have multiple orders, and each order can contain multiple products.

The system's primary goal is to enable customers to browse and purchase products quickly and efficiently while also enabling the platform to manage customer orders, payments, and product inventory accurately. The inventory management system will be automated, ensuring that product availability is updated automatically when an order is placed. In addition, the platform will allow customers to track their orders and manage their accounts, including shipping information and order history.

The platform will allow users to browse and  purchase products, as well as track their orders and manage their  accounts. Entities can include: Customers, Products, Orders, Payment,  Reviews, Shipping, Reviews. Each customer can have multiple orders,  but each order can only belong to one customer. Each order can contain multiple products, and each product can be included in multiple orders. The stock availability for each product should be updated  automatically when an order is placed. The e-commerce platform should  be able to efficiently and accurately manage customer orders, payments, and product inventory.
